/** Base template trait for graphs.
  *
  * This trait provides the common structure and base operations for immutable graphs
  * independently of their representation. Base operations also cover one-step traversals.
  * For unlimited traversals see `trait GraphTraversal`.
  *
  * Users of Graph usually don't interact directly with this trait but with
  * `trait Graph` instead which inherits the functionality provided by this trait.
  *
  * If `E` inherits `DirectedEdgeLike` the graph is directed, otherwise it is undirected or mixed.
  *
  * @tparam N    the user type of the nodes (vertices) in this graph.
  * @tparam E    the kind of the edges (links) in this graph.
  * @define INNODES The isolated (and optionally any other) outer nodes that the node set of
  *         this graph is to be populated with.
  * @define INEDGES The outer edges that the edge set of this graph is to be populated with.
  *         Nodes being the end of any of these edges will be added to the node set.
