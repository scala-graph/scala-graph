/* Operations common to mutable and immutable graphs.

  $define mapNodes  computes a new graph by applying `fNode` to all nodes of this graph
  $define mapEdges  computes a new graph by applying `fNode` to all nodes and `fEdge` to all edges of this graph
  $define mapNN     the node type of the resulting graph. It may be unchanged or different from this graphs node type
  $define mapEC     the higher kind of the edge type parameter of this graph
  $define mapFNode  function to map the inner nodes of this graph to any type that becomes the node type of the resulting graph
  $define $mapFEdge function to map edges based on the mapped nodes. It is expected to set the node ends to the passed nodes.
                    If this expectation is not met the resulting graph may become deteriorated.
