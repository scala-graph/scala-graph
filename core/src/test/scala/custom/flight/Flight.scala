/** This object defines the edge type `Flight` needed for the flight route
  * map example as a custom edge type.
  *
  * A `Flight` has several attributes like `departure` and `duration`.
  * To enable duplicate flights between airports, `flightNo` is added
  * to the key attributes.
  *
  * Note that this is not a real-life design. For instance, calculating
  * the shortest path does not consider waiting times on the airports,
  * it just uses the flight duration.
  *
  * For usage see Ttest_shortestPathFunctional in TAlgo.scala.
  * There, things are more complex due to the `factory` variable for
  * which you could just write `Graph` in a real app, instead.
